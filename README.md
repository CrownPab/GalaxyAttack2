# Galaxy Attack 2 

This is a project I built for my Interactive Media class in Unity. It is a 2D action space shooter called Galaxy Attack 2. I built this game using unity


## About

For my 2D project I decided to build a sequel to the very first game that I ever built and that is Galaxy Attack. 

I built Galaxy Attack 1 when I was 15 years old and first started out programming in visual basic. As you can see the game was fairly barebones at the time and was not a very fun space shooter but it was a huge moment for me because it was the first project I had ever done from scratch. It was after building this game that I decided to become a software developer 

In the video I linked below I included a 20 second clip of the original galaxy attack on top of the one minute clip of the new game that I built for this project.

## Controls 
    Arrow keys to move Ship 
    
    Space Bar to shoot 


## Assets 

All the Music and the Sound Effects were made by me 

I made the menu music, gameplay music, and game over screen music on my stem player first and then went into filmora to edit the audio to how I wanted it after the fact. I also went through the same process for the sound effects 

The Title Logo, Play button, UI Components, Game Over Logo, and Planets were made by me as well 

The Ship, The Enemy, Bullets, and explosion animation were found on kenney but some of the colours were changed by me after the fact
